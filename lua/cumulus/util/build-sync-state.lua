-- Cumulus Build Sync Readiness State
--
-- Tracks whether the one-time Maven/Gradle dependency sync (see
-- lua/cumulus/core/autocmds.lua's "build_sync" VimEnter autocmd and
-- maven.sync_dependencies()/gradle.sync_dependencies()) has finished for
-- this session, so the java/kotlin/maven-related keymaps in
-- lua/cumulus/core/lang-keymaps.lua can stay hidden until dependencies are
-- actually resolved -- matching the "keybindings only show after sync
-- completes" behavior.

local M = {}

M.ready = false

-- True while a sync spawned by run() is in flight. apply() in
-- lang-keymaps.lua only ever ADDS keymaps, never removes them, so a
-- ready_gate keymap already bound to a buffer (e.g. <leader>cjS itself)
-- stays pressable even while `ready == false` -- only the which-key popup
-- hides it. Without this guard, pressing it twice in quick succession would
-- spawn two independent, uncoordinated sync processes.
M.syncing = false

local listeners = {}

--- Mark the sync as finished (success, failure, or "nothing to sync") and
--- fire every listener registered via on_ready(). Safe to call more than
--- once -- only the first call fires listeners, but syncing is always
--- cleared so a stuck M.syncing flag can never outlive its sync attempt.

--- runs immediately (synchronously).

--- Re-arm the state for a manual resync (see keymaps.lua's <leader>cjS).
--- Deliberately does NOT touch `listeners` -- mark_ready() iterates that
--- table without draining it, so every callback already registered via
--- on_ready() (e.g. lang-keymaps.lua's which-key refresh) fires again on
--- the next mark_ready() with no need to re-register.
function M.reset()

end

--- Detect the project's build tool and (re)run its dependency sync, or mark
--- ready immediately if there's nothing to sync. Single source of truth for
--- both the one-time VimEnter sync (autocmds.lua) and the manual resync
--- keymap, so the branch only lives in one place. No-ops while a sync is
--- already in flight (see M.syncing above) instead of spawning a second,
--- overlapping mvn/gradle process.
